# pokerbot

A simple discord bot I created to simplify roll calls for weekly poker games.

Click one of the three buttons to put your discord nickname into the corresponding column and change your status anytime instantly. 
- When the command is re-submitted for a new roll call, it will automatically lock submissions into previous roll calls. 
- Add custom text and details like "Saturday at 6"
- Remains active indefinitely, buttons don't timeout after a long time or even after a restart.
- Numerical count of how many people in each category
- Not really anymore features I can think of its pretty simple
